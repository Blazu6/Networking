# Routing Solutions & Problems

This directory contains solutions to various tasks and challenges related to routing. It includes algorithmic approaches, network routing concepts, and practical implementations to solve routing-related problems.

## Contents

- **Graph-based algorithms** (e.g., Dijkstra, A*)
- **Network routing protocols** (e.g., OSPF, BGP)
- **Pathfinding and optimization**
- **Load balancing and traffic engineering**

Each solution is documented with explanations and, where applicable, includes example inputs and outputs.
